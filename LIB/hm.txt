Use the definite assignment assertion ! to tell TypeScript that you will ensure the properties are assigned before they are used:
export class Course {
    id!: number;
    title!: string;
    price!: number;
    desc!: string;
    image!: string;
    rating!: number;
    duration!: number;
    author!: string;
}
